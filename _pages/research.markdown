## <a name="research"></a>Research Interests
I am interested in using mathematical tools, primarily from information theory, to understand neural coding; that is how neurons represent information about the outside world.
Understanding how neurons represent information is an important step to understanding how they process that information, which is a key question underlying behaviour and consciousness

I am also interested in using numerical optimisation techniques to maximise information theoretic measures such as entropy or mutual information. During my PhD I have developed an algorithm for efficiently obtaining probability distributions on finite alphabet spaces with maximum entropy among those satisfying marginal constraints. Comparing these maximum entropy models with the true distributions measured from the system being studied allows quantification of the effects of interactions between the different variables in the system.
