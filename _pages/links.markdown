###<a name="ln"></a>Lectures/Notes

* [Spike Train Analysis Network - Online seminars](http://www.spiketrain.org/Seminars.html) : a range of seminars that take place live online (you can email questions etc.) but are also archived for later viewing.
* [Statistical analysis of neural data](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~liam/teaching/neurostat-spr09/) : learning materials available online for a course taught at Columbia by [Liam Paninski](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~liam/).

##<a name="software"></a>Software
Here is a list of some software I use regularly.

* I have been happily Windows free for some time now, using [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) on a laptop and [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) on workstations.
* I primarily use the [MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/) variant of the [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) editor.
* For version control I use [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) to store a main repository and [Bazaar](http://bazaar-vcs.org/) for smaller things. I chose bzr since it seems to have the best integration with subversion, so I can start a small project and if it develops into something I want to keep I can push it into my main SVN repository with history preserved.
* I use [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/), despite some [rediculous](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=311292) longstanding [bugs](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45375).
* I work a lot in the [iTerm terminal](http://iterm.sourceforge.net) with such essentials as [ssh](http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/use-ssh-create-http-proxy), [screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/), etc.
* For document preparation I prever to use LaTex via the [MacTex](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) distribution, either straight from Vim or with [Lyx](http://www.lyx.org/) editor.
* For bibliography management I use [BibDesk](http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net) which I populate with BibTex from [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com) (although you have to take care as sometimes the screen scraped Googe records can be quite inaccurate). I read PDF's with with [Skim](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/) viewer from the same author.
* I built this website using the [Template Toolkit](http://template-toolkit.org/) with the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) [plugin](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Template-Plugin-Markdown/).

###<a name="python"></a>Python
The Python programming language, together with the numerical libraries NumPy and SciPy provide a compelling alternative to MATLAB for scientific computation.

* The [Python](http://www.python.org/) programming language.
* The numerical libraries [NumPy and SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/). 
* The [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/) plotting package.
* The [IPython](http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/) interactive interpreter.
* The [Cython](http://cython.org/) language.
* There are some bundled installers which include everything you need, such as [Python(x,y)](http://www.pythonxy.com/) (windows, quite current) and [EPD](http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php) (cross platform, commercial but free for academic use).
* You can find some information about the advantages of Python [here](http://www.stat.washington.edu/~hoytak/blog/whypython.html). I also like these examples of how easy it is to [improve performance](http://www.scipy.org/PerformancePython) and to [parallelise](http://www.scipy.org/ParallelProgramming) your code.

##<a name="other"></a>Other Stuff

* I like playing acoustic guitar. [fingerstyleblues.com](http://www.fingerstyleblues.com/) is a site with some really nice beginner fingerstyle exercises and [classtab.org](http://www.classtab.org/) is a great resource for classical guitar tab.
